# ODS in the Classroom - Climapoly

## Project Description

This project has been developed as a solution to the "ODS in the Classroom" challenge for the NASA contest. "Climapoly" is an educational tool designed for use in secondary science classes, focused on the assessment process and interactive learning about Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 13, which is concerned with climate action.

## Functionality

Climapoly operates on the concept of a game similar to Monopoly, where students progress on an interactive board by answering questions and solving challenges related to climate change and measures to combat it. Each correct answer allows the student to advance on the board and accumulate points, thus fostering a competitive and collaborative learning environment.

## Educational Objective

The primary goal of Climapoly is to enrich students' knowledge about SDG 13, providing them with a deeper understanding of current climate change challenges and effective strategies for mitigation. Through the game, students not only learn about facts and policies but also develop critical thinking skills that are essential for their academic and personal growth.

## Use in the Classroom

Climapoly is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing curricula. Educators can use this game as part of their class sessions to assess and reinforce students' knowledge in an interactive way. The game structure allows for adaptations according to the specific needs of each student group, making each session a unique and educational experience.

## Conclusion

This project contributes to environmental education and promotes awareness of the importance of climate action through a playful and interactive methodology. We hope that Climapoly will become a fundamental tool in secondary science classrooms and help to form conscientious citizens prepared to face the environmental challenges of the future.
